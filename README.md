## Programming paradigms & types of languages

A relatively top-to bottom beginner to advanced approach to paradigms and concepts like OOP, inheritance, diamond problem, etc.

Table of contents (level 1 and level 2 for OOP):

- Unstructured vs Structured
- High level vs Low level
- Compiled vs Interpreted
- Dynamically typed vs statically typed
- Imperative & Declarative
- Procedural programming
- Functional programming
- Data-driven programming
- Object-Oriented programming
  - Class-based vs prototype-based
  - The getters setters debate
  - Composition, inheritance, and delegation
  - Polymorphism
  - Ad hoc vs Subtyping
  - Behavioral subtyping
  - Object-orientation and databases
  - Object-relational mapping
  - Responsibility- vs. data-driven design
  - Criticism (OOP)
- Probabilistic Programming

Where not necessary, I did not use my own words - that is, most of the time.

It still counts as work in progress. I don't expect to make changes any time soon.

Markdown quotes also denote extra info, aside from actual quotes. Initial draft was written in Obsidian. Now I've shared it on GitHub (for the 2nd time).

Note that level 5 and 6 headings appear similar. Perhaps GitHub's stylistic render of Markdown needs adjustment as headings appear smaller than regular text.

Since this is a re-upload and I'm deleting the old repo, here's a snapshot of my contributions last year. A large number are a reflection of working on programming paradigms.
